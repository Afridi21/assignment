            <p class="text-1">To donate means to give something — money, goods, or time — to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply "giving"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.</p>

By donating money to charity, you will achieve a greater sense of satisfaction and growth as it feels good to help others and provide them with all the essential resources.</p>
