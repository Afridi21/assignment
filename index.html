            <p class="text-1">To donate means to give something — money, goods, or time — to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply "giving"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.</p>

It provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents ill health and disease. Adequate housing provides people with dignity and the opportunity to lead a normal life. </p>

Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too.</p>
